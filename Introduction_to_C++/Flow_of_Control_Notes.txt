RELATIONAL OPERATORS:
> Greater than
>= Greater than or equal to
< Less than
<= Less than or equal to
== Equal to
!= Not equal to

LOGICAL OPERATORS:
&& and
|| or
! not

note false = 0 and anything else in the language holds a true value

NOTE don't need scope in if/else/else if if it's only one line (so no {} for only one line-ers)

SWITCH SYNTAX: NOTE SPECIAL SYNTAX: NO BREAK IN DEFAULT, BREAK IN EACH CASE, AND :
switch(expression)
{
case constant1:
statementA1;
statementA2;
...
break;

case constant2:
statementB1;
statementB2;
...
break;

...

default:
statementZ1;
statementZ2;
...

}

***while loops behave normally

DO-WHILE LOOPS: gurantees loop is executed at least once (so checks after)

do
{

}
while(condition);

for loops act the same with folowing syntax (NOTE: i++ vs ++i doesn't matter here):
for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
{
    //this would execute 10 times
}
NOTE IF COUNTER VARIABLE IS ALREADY DEFINED YOU DON'T NEED TO DEFINE IT:
for(; counter < 10; counter++)
{
    
}

a for loop can be expressed by a while loop and vice-versa
