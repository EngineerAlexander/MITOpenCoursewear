Part a)
permuations_of_string.py will get all permutations of a given string using recursion.

Part b)
caesar_cipher.py is a class for instantiating plaintext and ciphertext objects with some shared attributes and some unique
it enables decryption and encryption of strings by using caesar-ciphers (essentially just numbercal shifts on old letters to new ones
depending on the order they appear in the alphabet and the shift given). Class is used to decrypt a story as an example.

Part c)
substitution_cipher.py is a class (similar to the one for caesar-ciphers) that enables the encryption and decryption via random substitution
of vowels in a string. Note this was not done for consanants as well since 26! possible combinations would exist for the dictionary mappings
permutations_of_string.py was brought in to enable easy calculation of all permutations of a string of vowels for building the dicts 
to iterate over.
