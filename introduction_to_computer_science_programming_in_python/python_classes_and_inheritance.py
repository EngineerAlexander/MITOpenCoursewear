# CLASS VARIABLES

# self reffers to some instance while defining the class
# object is the class parent
# define this new class animal (child) that inherits all the methods and properties from another class, object (parent)
class Animal(object):

# you can access data values directly with . BUT IT IS NOT RECOMMENDED
# AUTHOR OF CLASS DEFINITION MAY CHANGE DATA ATTRIBUTE VARIABLE NAMES
# THIS CAN PROPOGATE ERRORS OUTSIDE OF CLASS IN CODES WHERE CLASS IS BEING USED

# PYTHON IS NOT GREAT AT INFORMATION HIDING
#   It allows you to access data, write to data, and create data attributes for an instance from outside the class definition
#   DO NOT DO ANY OF THESE!

# DEFAULT ARGUMENTS (USED IF NO ARGUMENT IS GIVEN)
# Class...

# hierarchies of class for inheritance
# child classes can then add more info, add more behavior, or override behavior
# everything should somewhere in the flow inherit the object class
# object class enables the veyr basic operation in python like binding variables, etc.

# PARENT CLASS IS (SUPERCLASS) AND CHILD CLASS IS (SUBCLASS)

# EXAMPLE OF DEFINING A CHILD CLASS CAT TO PARENT CLASS ANIMAL THAT HAD PARENT CLASS OBJECT
# OVERRIDS __str__ and ADDS NEW FUNCTIONALITY via speak method
